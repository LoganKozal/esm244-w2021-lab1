```

### Read in SF trees data

```{r}
sf_trees <- read_csv(here("data","sf_trees","sf_trees.csv"))
```
### Basic wrangling reminders

Refresh some skills for data wrangling & summary statistics using functions in the `dplyr` package. 

Find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal status, do some wrangling, make a graph.

```{r}
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>% 
  count(legal_status) %>%   # combines recognize groups, summarize, can list multiple levels 
  drop_na(legal_status) %>% 
  rename(tree_count = n) %>% 
  dplyr::relocate(tree_count) %>% 
  slice_max(tree_count, n=5)

```
